# Sublime Text 2 plugin: Simple Rails Navigator

Simple plugin for navigating Ruby on Rails applications.

This plugin provides commands for listing models, controllers, views, helpers,
fixtures, tests/specs, javascript files, or stylesheets in a quick panel for
easy selection.

Related files are located at the top of the list so that they can be selected
simply by pressing Enter. For instance, if the active view is a Rails model
and you request a list of controllers, the controller corresponding to the
model will be listed at the top, provided that you follow normal Rails
resource conventions with the controller name containing the pluralized
version of the model name (e.g. `post.rb` and `posts_controller.rb`).

The same goes for tests or specs (in the example case, the test file should be
called `test/unit/post_test.rb` or `spec/models/post_spec.rb`). If the
application contains a `spec` directory, the plugin will search for specs and
ignore the `test` directory; otherwise the `test` directory will be used.

The following table shows which related files will be put at the top of the list:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Active file</td>
      <td>Listing these file types will show related files at the top of the list</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>model</td>
      <td>controller; fixture; model unit test/model spec</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>controller</td>
      <td>model; views; helper; functional test/controller spec</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>view</td>
      <td>controller; functional test/view spec</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>helper</td>
      <td>controller; helper unit test/helper spec</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fixture</td>
      <td>model; model unit test/model spec; functional test/controller spec</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>model unit test/model spec</td>
      <td>model; fixture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>functional test</td>
      <td>controller; views; fixture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>controller spec</td>
      <td>controller; fixture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>view spec</td>
      <td>view</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>helper unit test/helper spec</td>
      <td>helper</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>routes.rb</td>
      <td>route specs</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This plugin was inspired by Luqman Amjad's Rails Related Files plugin. The
plugins have complementary functionality (Amjad's plugin shows related files
of all types in a single list), and they can be used together.

## Installation

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package
Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Simple Rails Navigator when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep the Simple Rails Navigator up to date
with the latest version.

### Clone from GitHub

Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly from GitHub into your Packages directory:

    git clone http://github.com/noklesta/SublimeRailsNav

## Key bindings

The plugin does not install any key bindings automatically. The following is
an example of how you can set up your own key bindings. To make sure they
don't conflict with existing commands, first run `sublime.log_commands(True)`
in the console, try out the key combinations and see if anything is logged.

    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+m"], "command": "list_rails_models" },
    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+c"], "command": "list_rails_controllers" },
    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+v"], "command": "list_rails_views" },
    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+h"], "command": "list_rails_helpers" },
    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+x"], "command": "list_rails_fixtures" },
    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+t"], "command": "list_rails_tests" },
    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+i"], "command": "list_rails_javascripts" },
    { "keys": ["super+ctrl+y"], "command": "list_rails_stylesheets" }

If you are using Vintage mode and want to use sequences of non-modifier keys,
you can restrict the key bindings to command mode like this:

    { "keys": [" ", "m"], "command": "list_rails_models", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] },
    { "keys": [" ", "c"], "command": "list_rails_controllers", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] },
    { "keys": [" ", "v"], "command": "list_rails_views", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] },
    { "keys": [" ", "h"], "command": "list_rails_helpers", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] },
    { "keys": [" ", "x"], "command": "list_rails_fixtures", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] },
    { "keys": [" ", "t"], "command": "list_rails_tests", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] },
    { "keys": [" ", "i"], "command": "list_rails_javascripts", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] },
    { "keys": [" ", "y"], "command": "list_rails_stylesheets", "context": [{"key": "setting.command_mode"}] }

All commands are also available from the Command Palette (search for commands beginning with "Simple Rails Navigator").

## Settings

The settings in SublimeRailsNav.sublime-settings may be overridden either in
Packages/User/SublimeRailsNav.sublime-settings or, for a particular project, in the
project file under a top-level "settings" key. An example of the latter:

    "settings":
    {
      "SublimeRailsNav":
      {
        "javascript_locations": [
          ["app", "assets", "javascripts"]
        ],
        "stylesheet_locations": [
          ["app", "assets", "stylesheets"],
          ["lib", "assets", "stylesheets"]
        ]
      }
    }

- Inspiration from Luqman Amjad's Rails Related Files plugin for ST2 and from Tim Pope's rails.vim plugin for Vim
(which contains sooo much more functionality than this one, of course :-)
- Python version of the Rails inflector: <https://bitbucket.org/ixmatus/inflector>
- Contains a modified version of a small code snippet from the Git package for ST2.
